    <p align="left"> Me, here! A bit about myself: I am <i>great</i> at photography and I love making people smile! I am currently a senior at Jungle Fine Arts Academy, concentrating in photography and the philosophy of identity. Don't worry, it's not all boring--I love bananas, baths, and babez! ;) Above is just a lil photo I took of myself... </p>
